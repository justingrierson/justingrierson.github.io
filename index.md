My career began in London designing Flash and 3D animation, and I’ve arrived as a full stack develeoper working in London & California.

I wonder what’s next...

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |


| Attribute      | Element    | Type           | Description |
| :------------------- | :----------------- | :--------------------- | :----------------- |
| `mdDesc`       | `mdColumn` | `[expression]` | If present, the column will sort descending first. The default is to sort ascending first. |
| `mdOnReorder`  | `mdHead`   | `function`     | A callback function for when the order changes. The callback will receive the new order. |
| `mdOrder`      | `mdHead`   | `string`       | A variable to bind the sort order to. |
| `mdOrderBy`    | `mdColumn` | `string`       | The value to bind to the sort order. |
