Hi there this is Justin and this is my blog and I will be making tutorials as well
Github's Octocat was designed by Simon Oxley, alongside the white bird Twitter used (before they received a proper logo) as part of a usual routine of cranking out images for iStock. GitHub saw it, and wanted it, presumably under the notion that it can represent how complex code combines to create peculiar things, much like the octopuss... except the CEO of GitHub called it an octocat, and it has been the octocat since <a href="https://www.quora.com/GitHub/What-is-the-story-behind-GitHub%E2%80%99s-octocat-mascot" target="_blank">[via]</a>.

<small>
Octocat is Github's logo and trademark and here is used to illustrate a fictional character (John Smith) that used the *{ Personal }* Jekyll Theme to build his website.
